### Code Contributors

This project exists thanks to all the people who [contribute](https://github.com/deltatoken/OpenCRMs/graphs/contributors) and more.
I felt it needs to be forked into a new edition with higher open source - since at time of fork only forked projects can use a custom logo or custom hyperlinks.
So as a contribute to real open source - i forked it - this is the forked editition - without any type of limitation - i.e you can use any logo, remove or change the trademark or the © Supercharged by SuiteCRM © Powered By SugarCRM (they are removed by default in the dev branch - which is fully functional)
